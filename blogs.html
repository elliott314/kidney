    <h2>KIDNEY DONATION AND FUNDRAISING</h2>
    <h5>Title description, Dec 7, 2017</h5>

    <p>A donated kidney is an organ that is removed 
      from a donor (a living or deceased person) and 
      surgically implanted in a person with kidney 
      failure.<br>
      A person can live with one healthy kidney.
      When both kidneys fail, the person must have
      dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.
      A donated kidney can come from a living or
      deceased donor. The donated kidney is 
      surgically implanted into the patient 
      with kidney failure. The living donor 
      can live a healthy life with his or her
      remaining kidney.<br>
      About 50,000 people in Nepal are waiting for a 
      kidney transplant. Getting an organ from a living
      donor offers the best chance at a healthy life for
      those waiting for a new kidney. Approximately 6,000 
      people a year choose to donate one of their kidneys —
      sometimes to a family member and sometimes to a 
      total stranger. <br>
      Once you’ve figured out how much you need during
      your recovery to meet your monthly routine cost-of-living
      expenses and current financial obligations (see Kidney
      Donation Cost-Estimation Worksheet ), you’ll be able to
      determine whether seeking additional financial resources
      is necessary for your personal situation. If you’re employed
      and have adequate vacation, sick leave, or short-term
      disability benefits then you may not have to do much more,
      should that income meet your needs. If you find that you
      don’t have resources to meet your monthly obligations then
      you may need to consider additional sources.
      It’s important to recognize whether or not you can afford to
      donate. This may sound strange, since you’re really trying
      to help another, but depending on the type of relationship
      you have with your recipient, this could be a huge factor as
      you weigh the financial impact donation may have on your
      current situation. Only you can decide this for yourself (with
      your family). If donation may impair your household financial situation, then you may have to choose not to donate.
      Financial stressors can sometimes negatively impact a donor’s experience and should be factored into your decision.
      The transplant community recognizes the financial impact
      donors may have and has attempted to create financial assistance programs for living donors to reduce any financial
      burden. (Please see Nonprofit Sources of Financial Assistance for Living Donors section.) You may, or may not, be
      eligible for available donor grants and should discuss your
      options with your donor social worker and/or Independent
      Donor Advocate.
      Some individuals explore alternative ways to cover expenses when off for donation. Although seeking funds may seem
      awkward, fundraising for living donors so they can donate
      may occur, or be necessary. The National Organ Transplant

    <h2>YOUR GIFT CAN GIVE SOMEONE NEW LIFE</h2>
    <h5>Title description, Dec 7, 2017</h5>

    <p></p>
    <p>“You were born with the ability to change someone’s life.
       Don’t ever waste it.” We often hear that we must help 
       ourselves before we can help someone else, and to some
       extent I believe that to be true. I am talking about 
       helping others by donating a kidney.People might scared 
       hearing this thing and they may have belief that they may 
       die with one kidney, people do not want to donate. But this 
       is not true.People easily can live with one kidney.They why 
       donot we donate?We help? I also find it to be true that one 
       of the best ways to help ourselves is to donate to help
       others.<br>

       You don’t have to take my word for it, there is tremendous
       amounts of research that have proven that saving someone’s
       life and being kind will make you happier and healthier.
       “People who donate tend to have higher self-esteem, 
       psycholgical well-being, and happiness,” Mark Snyder, a
       psychologist and head of the Center for the Study of
       the Individual and Society at the University of
       Minnesota says. “All of these things go up as their 
       feelings of social connectedness goes up, which in 
       reality, it does. It also improves their health and
       even their longevity.” <br>
       Another study states that
       “Psychologists have identified a typical state of 
       euphoria reported by those engaged in donation & 
       charitable activity. They call it “helper’s high,”
       and it’s based on the theory that giving produces
       endorphins in the brain that provide a mild version
       of a morphine high.” (excerpt from article by Jame's
       Baraz and Shoshana Alexander). Carolyn Schwartz,
       a research professor at the University of 
       Massachusetts Medical School did a research study
       which resulted in the following finding: <br>  
       Those who helped others were significantly happier 
       and less depressed than those who didn’t. And the 
       list of studies could go on and on.  The more you
       research it the more you can’t deny that helping
       others is the very best way to help yourself. I
       believe that each of us have the ability to 
       change other people’s life for the better. 
       Regardless of someone’s circumstances they 
       can always find a way to help someone else. Even 
       if that help comes through the form of a simple 
       smile or a hello.  Just recognizing and acknowledging 
       someone could be all it takes to change another person’s.<br>
      ”Never underestimate or dismiss your
       ability to change someone else’s life because
       you may be the very person that can do it.

    <h2>I HAVE SAVED HIS LIFE.YOU CAN BE A NEXT DONOR?</h2>
    <h5>Title description, february12, 2020</h5>
    <img class="float--left margin-right--md margin-bottom--md" src="assets/proud.jpg" height="200px">
    <p></p>
    <p> This is something that we face, and it is amazing, 
       just amazing that in this day and age medical science
       has gotten to that place where they can take an 
       organ out of one person’s body and put it into 
       another person’s body and save that person’s life,
       or extend that person’s life, or improve their 
       life.It’s an amazing thing, but it’s a personal
       decision for everybody.<br>
       I’m not trying to persuade anybody either way here,
       because it is a personal decision, but I’m just
       trying to say, do unto others as you’d have them
       do unto you.<br>
       My personal feeling is it’s not a sin to be a kidney
       donor. It’s actually a virtuous thing. When you
       think about it, it’s not really that big of a
       sacrifice on your part. I mean, you can aslo u live
       with one kidney. Science has proven that you can live
       longer with one kidney.Right? But very valuable to 
       anyone who receives the benefit of your kidney.<br>
       I want to share you my story. He was unknown to me.
       I never met him before. I first met him in the hospital
       I was there for my regular health checkup. I saw him 
       sad sitting in the canteen of the hospital with his wife
       and crying . I asked them what has happened. They told 
       me their story that his wife kidney didnot matched.Now he 
       has to loss his life . I had tears when i listen to them.
       I reserched about this donation. I met the doctors and 
       consult with them. I found out with my research that
       we can live with one kidney. I contact him aferthat we
       make an appointment with the doctors.Our kidney matched.
       Then I decide to give him this gift to save his life .
       <br>
       Finally all the process done out well. We both are happy
       and healthyy now and good friends too.
       My gift gave him a new life. Then why cannot you?
